    <h3>WEB DEVELOPMENT</h3>
    <p>Web development is the process of building and maintaining websites and web applications. It involves a combination of programming, designing, and content creation. Web developers use various programming languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create the structure, style, and functionality of a website. They also work with databases, server-side scripting languages, and frameworks to handle data and build dynamic web applications. Web development plays a crucial role in the digital world, enabling businesses and individuals to establish an online presence and deliver their content and services to a global audience.</p>
    <br>
    <p>One of the key aspects of web development is front-end development. Front-end developers focus on the user interface and the visual aspects of a website. They are responsible for creating responsive and interactive web pages that provide a seamless user experience across different devices and browsers. Front-end developers work with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build the structure, style, and behavior of the website. They utilize frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue.js to enhance efficiency and productivity. Front-end development requires a combination of technical skills, creativity, and an understanding of user experience design principles.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Another important aspect of web development is back-end development. Back-end developers handle the server-side of web applications, dealing with databases, server logic, and performance optimization. They use programming languages such as Python, PHP, Ruby, or Java to develop the server-side functionality that powers the web application. Back-end developers often work with frameworks like Django, Ruby on Rails, or Node.js to streamline development processes. They ensure data integrity, implement security measures, and handle user authentication. Back-end development is crucial for creating robust and scalable web applications that can handle a large volume of traffic and user interactions.</p>
